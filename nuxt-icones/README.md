## Nuxt 3 + Icônes
This demo shows how to include [icons by Icônes](https://icones.js.org/) in [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).

Icons are defined as components with absolutely no external dependencies, which makes this my preferred way 
over e.g. Font Awesome integration (shown in `nuxt-fa`).

### How to use
1. `git checkout demos-nuxt project`
2. `cd nuxt-icones`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` 
5. `localhost:3000`
