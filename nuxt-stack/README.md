## Nuxt Stack
This is my current setup I'd use to start new "real world" webapp. 
This will improve and grow together with my skills.
I will also try to include **WHAT** and **WHY** comments.

### Features
- Nuxt 3 application framework atop Vue.js
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Pinia for state management
- Supabase for auth and DB services
- FormKit for input forms
- Fortawesome for providing FontAwesome icons

### How to use
1. `git checkout demos-nuxt project`
2. `cd nuxt-stack`
3. `npm install`
4. `setup supabase`
5. `npm run dev` 
6. `localhost:3000`
