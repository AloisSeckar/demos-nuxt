## Nuxt 3 minimal starter
This demo shows simple working example of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)

### About
It basically contains the same as [Nuxt Starter on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz) encouraged by Nuxt team to provide minimal bug reproduction, but without `<NuxtWelcome>` component and with two additional features I find useful:
- [default layout](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts) & [default page](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages) for better website organization
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for static JS code analysis

All other demos presented in my `demos-nuxt` project (except `nuxt-minimal`) are built atop this one.

I recommend this setup for learning and testing purposes. As a starting point for a real application, I'd advise you to pick `nuxt-stack` which is combined from more features and integrations.

### How to use
1. `git checkout demos-nuxt project`
2. `cd nuxt-simple`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` 
5. `localhost:3000` 

Congratulations. You have working Nuxt 3 app project enhanced with ESLint.
