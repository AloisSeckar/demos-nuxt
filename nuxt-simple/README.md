## Nuxt Starter
This demo shows simple working example of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)

### About
It basically contains the same as [Nuxt Starter on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v3-stackblitz) encouraged by Nuxt team to provide minimal bug reproduction, but without `<NuxtWelcome>` component and with additional [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration for static JS code analysis, which I found very useful and worth adopting from your very first steps.

All other demos presented in my `demos-nuxt` project (except `nuxt-minimal`) are built atop this one.

I recommend this setup for learning and testing purposes or for simple projects only. As a starting point for a real application, I'd advise you consider picking my [`nuxt-stack`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-stack) which is combined with more useful features and integrations.

You can also find this starter as a [standalone GitHub project](ttps://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-starter) for easier forking and cloning.

### How to use
1. `git checkout demos-nuxt project`
2. `cd nuxt-simple`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` 
5. `localhost:3000` 

Congratulations. You have working Nuxt app project enhanced with ESLint.
