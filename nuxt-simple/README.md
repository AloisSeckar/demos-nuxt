## Nuxt Starter
This demo shows simple working example of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)

### About
It basically contains the same as [Nuxt Starter on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v4) encouraged by Nuxt team to provide minimal bug reproduction, but without `<NuxtWelcome>` component and with additional [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration for static JS code analysis, which I found very useful and worth adopting from your very first steps.

All other demos presented in [`demos-nuxt`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/demos-nuxt) project (except [`nuxt-minimal`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/demos-nuxt/tree/main/nuxt-minimal)) are built atop this one.

I recommend this setup for learning and testing purposes or for simple projects only. As a starting point for a real application, I'd advise you consider picking my [`nuxt-ignis`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-ignis) which is combined with more useful features and integrations.

You can also find this starter as a [standalone GitHub project](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-v4-starter) for easier forking and cloning.

### How to use
1. `git checkout demos-nuxt project`
2. `cd nuxt-simple`
3. `pnpm install`
4. `pnpm dev` 
5. `localhost:3000` 

Congratulations. You have working **Nuxt v4** app project enhanced with ESLint.
