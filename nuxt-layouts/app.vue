    layouts are useful to declare common parts of an appliction only
    once and in a dedicated place where everyone familiar with Nuxt
    will look for them

    NOTE: only use layouts if you have MORE THAN ONE possible page layouts in your application
    if there is only one, it is recommended by Nuxt team to put the common parts into app.vue

<template>
  <NuxtLayout>
    <NuxtPage />
